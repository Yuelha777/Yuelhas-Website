    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><strong>"Stay close to what feels like sunshine."</strong> </p>
    <p>Hi! My name is Yuelha Yeshey Tshogyal and I was born on the 20th of August, 2011 on a very sunny day! I completed my primary education at Sersang Primary School and Thimphu Primary School, which are both located in Thimphu. I am currently studying in the 9th grade at <strong>The Royal Academy, Paro, Pangbesa</strong> I have a younger sister who is currently studying in the 4th grade at Druk School,Thimphu.
    I also have a stepsister, who is currently studying in the 9th grade and Lungtenzampa Higher Secondary School, Thimphu.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Growing up, I have always been very enthusiastic about reading. I love reading different genre of books such as history, romance, and mystery. I also love playing chess. It helps me think clearly, focus better, and make smart decisions. Chess also teaches me patience, planning, and solving problems, and I can use these skills in school and everyday life. I also like reading tarot cards. It may sound weird at first, but it’s something I really enjoy because it helps me reflect on different situations and think deeply. Reading tarot encourages me to use my intuition, consider different perspectives, and explore creative ways of thinking. It’s also a fun and relaxing activity that inspires curiosity and self-reflection, and it gives me a way to connect with my thoughts and ideas in a meaningful way.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy watching football because it’s exciting, teaches me strategy, and inspires me with teamwork and skill. My favourite football club is FC Barcelona, one of the biggest football clubs in the world. I love watching their matches because their style of play is exciting and full of skill. I enjoy seeing how the players work together as a team and score amazing goals. Following Barcelona has made me more interested in football and has taught me the value of teamwork, practice, and never giving up. My favourite football player is Frenkie De Jong. I really like Frenkie de Jong because he is an amazing football player with great skills and intelligence on the field. I enjoy watching how he controls the ball, passes accurately, and helps his team both in attack and defense. His calmness under pressure and ability to make smart decisions during matches inspire me. Frenkie de Jong is not only talented but also works hard and shows dedication, which makes him my favorite player to watch. </p>
